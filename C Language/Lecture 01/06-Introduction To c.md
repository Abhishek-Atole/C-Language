## **📜 History of C Programming Language**  

### **1️⃣ The Birth of C**  
- **Developers**: Dennis Ritchie & Ken Thompson 🧑‍💻  
- **Year**: 1972  
- **Place**: AT&T Bell Labs, USA  
- **Purpose**: Development of the **UNIX** operating system  
- **Inspired by**: BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language)

### **2️⃣ Evolution Timeline**  
| **Year**  | **Event**  |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| 1965  | **Multics** operating system development begins. |
| 1969  | **Multics** project is halted. |
| 1970  | **Ken Thompson** develops the **B Language** (derived from BCPL by Martin Richards). |
| 1972  | **Dennis Ritchie** creates **C** to overcome B's limitations. |
| 1973  | **UNIX** is rewritten in **C**, making it portable. |
| 1978  | **K&R C** is introduced with "The C Programming Language" book. |
| 1983  | **ANSI C (C89)** is standardized. |
| 1990  | **ISO C (C90)** becomes the international standard. |
| 1999  | **C99** introduces inline functions and variable-length arrays. |
| 2011  | **C11** adds **multithreading support** ⚡. |
| 2018  | **C18** is released (latest minor update). |

### **3️⃣ The Need for C**  
🔹 Before C, **Assembly language** was widely used but **hardware-dependent**.  
🔹 The **B language**, developed by Ken Thompson, was too limited.  
🔹 **Dennis Ritchie** designed **C** to offer **portability, efficiency, and structure** for system programming.

### **4️⃣ Standardization of C**  
| **Standard** | **Year** | **Key Additions** |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **K&R C** | 1978 | First widely used version of C |
| **ANSI C (C89)** | 1983 | Function prototypes, portability improvements |
| **ISO C (C90)** | 1990 | First international C standard |
| **C99** | 1999 | Inline functions, variable-length arrays |
| **C11** | 2011 | Multithreading, atomic operations |
| **C18** | 2018 | Minor bug fixes and refinements |

### **5️⃣ Features of C**  
✅ **General-Purpose** – Suitable for system software, applications, compilers, etc.  
✅ **Procedural** – Uses structured programming with functions.  
✅ **Block Structured** – Organizes code within `{}` blocks.  
✅ **Compiled** – Code is translated into machine code via a compiler.  
✅ **Statically Typed** – Variables require explicit declaration.  
✅ **Flexible Flow Control** – Supports loops, conditionals, and function calls.  
✅ **Low-Level Access** – Provides direct interaction with memory and hardware.  
✅ **Portable & Efficient** – Runs across different platforms with minimal changes.  
✅ **Standardized** – Supported by K&R, ANSI, ISO, and modern standards.

### **6️⃣ Prerequisites for Learning C**  
🔹 **Basic Computer Knowledge** – Understanding how computers function.  
🔹 **Logical Thinking** – Helps in writing efficient algorithms.  
🔹 **Fundamentals of Programming** – Concepts like variables, loops, and functions.  
🔹 **Operating System Basics** – Essential for system-level programming.

### **7️⃣ Influence of C on Modern Languages**  
Many languages, including **C++, Java, Python, and Go**, are based on C.  
C is still widely used in **operating systems, embedded systems, and game development**.
